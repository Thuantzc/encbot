Telegram Encryption Bot
Introduction
Welcome to the Telegram Encryption Bot! This bot is built with Node.js
and allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages as well as code snippets using AES and RSA encryption algorithms. It leverages the crypto library for encryption and 
node-telegram-bot-api for seamless integration with Telegram.

Features
Message Encryption: Encrypt your messages using the AES algorithm.
Message Decryption: Decrypt messages that were encrypted with AES.
RSA Encryption: Securely encrypt messages using RSA.
RSA Decryption: Decrypt messages that were encrypted with RSA.
Code Encryption: Encrypt blocks of code using AES.
User Support: Get help by using the /support command.
